# ATOM Archive

**Welcome to ATOM — Algorithms, Techniques, Optics, Mechanics**

A personal and community-driven archive of resources for programming, graphics, physics, and math.  
This project is for people who enjoy building things from scratch, exploring how systems work under the hood, and sharing what they learn.
