**Welcome to ATOM — Algorithms, Techniques, Optics, Mechanics**

A personal and community-driven archive of resources for programming, graphics, physics, and math.  
This project is for people who enjoy building things from scratch, exploring how systems work under the hood, and sharing what they learn.

## About

This archive includes guides, notes, links, and learning materials that we personally use and keep for reference.  
If you find it helpful too — great! If you have useful resources to share, feel free to:

- Post them in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YDnXBnj9kh)
- Or contribute directly to the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/parven05/Atom)

Everyone is welcome to help improve and update the site to make it easier for others to use and explore.
