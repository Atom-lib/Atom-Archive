# ATOM Archive

**Welcome to ATOM — Algorithms, Techniques, Optics, Mechanics**

This is a personal and community collection of resources related to programming, graphics, physics, and math.  
It’s made for people who enjoy building things, breaking them apart, and learning how they really work under the hood.

The archive includes guides, notes, links, and learning materials. I use it for reference, and I hope others find it helpful too.

If you have good resources to share, you can post them in the Discord server or add them directly to the website’s source code on GitHub.  
Everyone is encouraged to help update and improve the site to make it easier to use for others in the future.
